  <h1 class="fade-up">Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="effective-date fade-up delay-1">Effective date: February 13, 2026</p>

  <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Pheid mobile application (the "App") operated by Novino Inc. ("Novino", "we", "us", or "our"). By using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

  <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 16 years old to use Pheid. By creating an account, you confirm that you are at least 16 years of age. If you are under 16, you may not create an account or use the App.</p>
  <p>For use cases involving minors under 16 (for example, a sports team), a parent or legal guardian must hold the account and manage the notifier on behalf of the group.</p>

  <h2>2. Accounts</h2>
  <p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and for all activity that occurs under it. You may authenticate using Google Sign-In, Sign in with Apple, or email magic link. You may not share your account credentials or allow others to access your account.</p>
  <p>You may set a handle (e.g., @yourname) and custom notifier codes. Handles are permanent and cannot be changed. You may not select a handle that impersonates another person, organization, or brand, or that contains offensive or misleading content. We reserve the right to reclaim or remove handles at our sole discretion, including for trademark claims or policy violations.</p>
  <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.</p>

  <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>Pheid is a notification platform. You are responsible for the content you broadcast through notifiers you create. You agree not to use the App to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Send illegal, threatening, harassing, or abusive content</li>
    <li>Distribute spam, phishing attempts, or malware links</li>
    <li>Send sexually explicit or pornographic content</li>
    <li>Promote violence, self-harm, or hate speech targeting any group</li>
    <li>Infringe on the intellectual property rights of others</li>
    <li>Impersonate another person or entity</li>
    <li>Send deceptive or fraudulent messages</li>
    <li>Interfere with or disrupt the App or its infrastructure</li>
    <li>Attempt to access other users' data without authorization</li>
    <li>Use the App for any purpose that violates applicable law</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We reserve the right to remove content and suspend or terminate accounts that violate this acceptable use policy, at our sole discretion and without prior notice.</p>

  <h2>4. Content Reporting</h2>
  <p>If you encounter content that violates these Terms, you can report it using the Report button within the App. We review all reports and may take action including removing content, warning the account holder, or suspending the account.</p>

  <h2>5. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>

  <h3>Free Tier</h3>
  <p>The App is free to use with the following limits: up to 3 notifiers, up to 50 subscribers per notifier, and up to 100 messages per month. Subscribing to notifiers created by others is always free.</p>

  <h3>Pro Subscription</h3>
  <p>A Pro subscription removes these limits. Pro is available as a monthly ($4.99/month) or yearly ($49.99/year) subscription. Prices may vary by region and are subject to change.</p>

  <h3>Billing</h3>
  <p>Subscriptions are billed through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Payment is charged to your App Store or Google Play account. Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.</p>

  <h3>Cancellation</h3>
  <p>You can cancel your subscription at any time through your device's App Store or Google Play subscription settings. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period — you retain Pro access until then.</p>

  <h3>Pro Expiry</h3>
  <p>When a Pro subscription expires:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Notifiers beyond the free limit (3) are frozen — subscribers can see past messages, but you cannot send new ones until you reduce your notifier count or resubscribe</li>
    <li>Existing subscribers above the 50-per-notifier limit remain, but no new subscribers can join until the count is below the limit</li>
    <li>Your message limit drops to 100 per month immediately</li>
    <li>No data is deleted — everything is preserved if you resubscribe</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Refunds</h3>
  <p>Refund requests are handled by Apple or Google according to their respective refund policies. We do not process refunds directly.</p>

  <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>The App and its original content (excluding user-generated content) are owned by Novino Inc. and protected by applicable intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or reverse-engineer the App.</p>
  <p>You retain ownership of the content you create and send through the App. By using the App, you grant us a limited license to store, transmit, and display your content as necessary to operate the service.</p>

  <h2>7. Account Deletion</h2>
  <p>You can delete your account at any time through the App's Settings screen. Deleting your account permanently removes all your data, including notifiers, subscriptions, messages, and profile information. This cannot be undone.</p>

  <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. We do not guarantee that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure. We do not guarantee the delivery, timing, or reliability of push notifications, as delivery depends on third-party services (Apple Push Notification service, Firebase Cloud Messaging) and device settings outside our control.</p>

  <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Novino Inc. shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App, including but not limited to missed notifications, data loss, or service interruptions.</p>
  <p>Our total liability for any claim arising from these Terms or your use of the App shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the 12 months preceding the claim, or $50, whichever is greater.</p>

  <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
  <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Novino Inc. from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from your use of the App, your content, or your violation of these Terms.</p>

  <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Province of Quebec, Canada, without regard to conflict of law provisions. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of Quebec.</p>

  <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes by posting a notice in the App or on this page. Your continued use of the App after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
